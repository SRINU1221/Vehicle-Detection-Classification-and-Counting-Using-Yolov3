## Description:
### Abstract:
Traffic tracking is one vicinity that makes use of deep getting to know for some of purposes. By the usage of cameras hooked up at positiveplaces at the roads, many duties including car counting, car identification, visitors violation tracking, car pace tracking, etc.. can be solved. The first step for automobile disclosure in YOLO v3 is to train a cnn with a large image collection containing vehicles can be done through superintended research where the CNN is fed a set of labeled images and learns to notice the presence and location of vehicles in the images.Once qualified CNN can be utilized to detect automobiles in real time by inputting images or video frames and outputting the detected vehicle position and class probabilities to the video. The orchestrates of the moving objects gravitational pull on the count line in different sections of the road its amount of motorcycles small cars and large vehicles is recorded the actual number of vehicles on the road is compared with the number of vehicles measured by the system using a confusion matrix three different counting periods were used to figure out the result.
